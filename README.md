# 'Tis But A Scratch game (Source Code)
A small game I've been working on for the 2022 Game Off game jam!


This is the source code repository for the game, it includes all the graphical assets and code used to make the game (Music and SFX not included)

The game is made using the Godot game engine, and it is A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.

Feel free to dig through the source code and learn from it. If you decide to use my source code to create a similar game, it would be apreciated if you credit me!


To play the game, visit the official Itch.io page at: https://blazingedgegames.itch.io/tis-but-a-scratch


Have fun, And happy gaming!
